## Description of Dataset
The consumer price index, known as CPI, is an indicator to show price changes of goods and services over time. It is like a basket full of all the goods and services that a Canadian pays for each month. Each item in the basket has its portion. For instance, we typically spend more money on gas than milk to take a significant amount in the basket than milk. The target populations are families and individuals living in urban and rural private households in Canada.

These prices are collected monthly from designated retail outlets by interviewers and other sources like the internet, telephone, etc. All quality and quantity changes have been cons,ered in the CPI.

There are some exceptions in collecting prices for goods and services or in the target population:
- Sales taxes and any other indirect taxes paid by consumers
- People living in the collective households, such as members of communal colonies, prison inmates, people living on Indian reserves
